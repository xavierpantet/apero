# Apero time

This repo is a collaborative initiative for sharing cool places to have drinks! The concept is simple: open a PR to add your favorite bar (one bar per PR). All places that get a least __5__ (subject to change as popularity increases) upvotes are added to the list!

Each bar should have the following informations:
- Name
- Short description
- Full address
- Website (if any)
- Price indicator ($ = cheap, $$ = moderate, $$$ = expensive)

## Bars
| Bar           | Description        | Address          | Website         | Price         |
